## About the Laser Loon ü¶¢

The Laser Loon design is an original illustration inspired by Minnesota‚Äôs natural beauty, cultural heritage, and partially by the iconic New Zealand Kiwi Laser Flag. Created with the intent to celebrate the state‚Äôs identity, the image prominently features:

- A stylized loon, Minnesota's state bird, depicted with dynamic and modern lines.
- Elements that evoke the state's lakes and wilderness.
